# Phase 1 minimum-path E2E: real kernel in QEMU + headless stub brain.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Build kernel + userspace if needed.
#   2. Launch tools/stub_brain.py on the host, listening on :9000
#      (matches `build/CONFIG.INI`'s `behavior_server_port`).
#   3. Launch `make qemu-full-smp` in the background.
#   4. The kernel boots, reads CONFIG.INI, dials 10.0.2.2:9000 (QEMU
#      user-net's alias for the host).
#   5. Stub brain receives SENSOR packets, replies with an
#      ActuatorCmd. After DURATION_S it self-terminates with exit 0
#      iff at least one sensor packet was received AND at least one
#      actuator command was sent. We then tear QEMU down.
#
# Exit code:
#   0  full loop closed (rx ≥ 1, tx ≥ 1)
#   1  loop incomplete (no packets, or only one direction)
#   2  no robot ever connected (kernel didn't dial us — boot failed,
#      bad CONFIG.INI, etc.)
#   anything else: setup error
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/e2e_wheeled_qemu.sh                  # default 30s run
#   DURATION_S=15 scripts/e2e_wheeled_qemu.sh    # shorter run
