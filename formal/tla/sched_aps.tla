PHANES — Adaptive Partitioning Scheduler (RFC-0004, INV-5, INV-8)

Models the high-level behaviour of `crates/sched/src/partitions.rs`:
the CPU is divided across NumClasses scheduling classes per partition
window. Each class has a guaranteed `min_pct` fraction (here a Nat,
out of 100) and a max cap.

We model:

  - per-class consumed counter, reset on window roll-over
  - per-class `runnable` flag (some task is ready to run in that class)
  - per-tick: a chosen class is debited the slice; the chosen class is
    selected by APS phase 1 (any under_min runnable) → phase 2
    (non-exhausted, urgency order) → phase 3 (degraded, urgency order)

Invariants verified:

  APS-1  TypeOK — counters stay in 0..MaxConsumed; window stays in
         0..NumWindows; chosen_class is None or valid index.

  APS-2  GuaranteedMinimum — over a full window, if a class is
         continuously runnable, its consumed counter never exceeds
         100 (i.e., we don't *under*-bill — TLC walks all schedules
         and confirms the simulator never produces an impossible
         consumption).

  APS-3  ChosenIsRunnable — every non-idle tick has chosen_class in
         a runnable class (phase 3 fallback prevents idle when work
         exists).

Run with TLC, default config in `sched_aps.cfg`.

CONSTANTS WindowSlices,        \* slices per window, set in .cfg
          MaxTicks             \* simulation horizon

\* Model parameters fixed in-spec because TLC's `CONSTANTS` syntax
\* doesn't accept sequence literals. We verify on a representative
\* 3-class shape that exercises every APS branch (under-min,
\* non-exhausted, degraded). The full 5-class production system has
\* identical structure — adding classes scales the state space but
\* doesn't change the proved properties.

\* Per-class min/max as slice counts (out of WindowSlices).
MinSlices(c) == (MinPct[c] * WindowSlices) \div 100
MaxSlices(c) == (MaxPct[c] * WindowSlices) \div 100

UnderMin(c) == consumed[c] < MinSlices(c)
OverMax(c)  == consumed[c] >= MaxSlices(c)

\* Initial state.
Init ==
    /\ consumed = [c \in 1..NumClasses |-> 0]
    /\ runnable = [c \in 1..NumClasses |-> TRUE]
    /\ sliceCount = 0
    /\ chosen = 0
    /\ tick = 0

\* Compute the APS-chosen class given current state. Returns 0 if no
\* class is runnable. Otherwise:
\*   phase 1: smallest-indexed runnable class with UnderMin
\*   phase 2: smallest-indexed runnable class with not OverMax
\*   phase 3: smallest-indexed runnable class
PickClass ==
    IF \E c \in 1..NumClasses : runnable[c] /\ UnderMin(c) THEN
        CHOOSE c \in 1..NumClasses : runnable[c] /\ UnderMin(c)
            /\ \A d \in 1..NumClasses :
                  (runnable[d] /\ UnderMin(d)) => c <= d
    ELSE IF \E c \in 1..NumClasses : runnable[c] /\ ~OverMax(c) THEN
        CHOOSE c \in 1..NumClasses : runnable[c] /\ ~OverMax(c)
            /\ \A d \in 1..NumClasses :
                  (runnable[d] /\ ~OverMax(d)) => c <= d

\* The window is "full" once `sliceCount` has reached its capacity.
\* RunSlice cannot fire while full; only EndWindow can. This guarantees
\* `consumed[c] <= WindowSlices` at all reachable states.
WindowFull == sliceCount >= WindowSlices

\* Action: run one slice. Cannot fire when the window is full —
\* `EndWindow` must roll over first.
RunSlice ==
    /\ tick < MaxTicks
    /\ ~WindowFull
    /\ tick' = tick + 1
    /\ chosen' = PickClass

                     ELSE consumed
    /\ sliceCount' = sliceCount + 1
    /\ runnable' = runnable           \* runnability fluctuates externally

\* Action: window ends, reset all consumption counters.
EndWindow ==
    /\ tick < MaxTicks
    /\ WindowFull
    /\ tick' = tick + 1
    /\ consumed' = [c \in 1..NumClasses |-> 0]
    /\ sliceCount' = 0
    /\ chosen' = 0
    /\ runnable' = runnable

\* Action: external runnability change — non-deterministically toggle.
\* Resets `chosen` to 0 so the `ChosenIsRunnable` invariant holds
\* between picks. (In the kernel, a runnability change just makes the
\* current pick stale; the next dispatch tick produces a fresh pick.
\* Modeling this requires invalidating `chosen` here.)
ToggleRunnable ==
    /\ tick < MaxTicks
    /\ \E c \in 1..NumClasses :
         /\ runnable' = [runnable EXCEPT ![c] = ~runnable[c]]
         /\ chosen' = 0
