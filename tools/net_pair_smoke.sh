# Two-node network smoke: boots two kernel instances wired together by QEMU's
# `socket` net backend and asserts that a 256-byte payload round-trips intact.
#
# Why two guests instead of QEMU user-mode networking: SLIRP only carries
# host<->guest traffic, and the host side is not our code. Here BOTH ends are
# this kernel, so the run exercises our TX path against our RX path — ARP, the
# IPv4 header checksum, the TCP handshake, and RX checksum validation in both
# directions. The TFTP smoke covers none of that (UDP, one direction, and the
# peer is QEMU's built-in server).
#
# Identity comes from the MAC QEMU assigns, so one kernel image serves both
# roles: last octet 01 => server 10.0.0.1, 02 => client 10.0.0.2.
#
# Exit: 0 only on an explicit client-side PASS. Any FAIL, panic, or timeout is
# non-zero — silence is never treated as success.
