//! DEV02 — USB DFU recovery mode kernel glue.
//!
//! Drives the [`robot_os_dfu`] crate's state machine end-to-end:
//! decodes incoming Setup packets, advances the DFU 1.1 FSM,
//! buffers DNLOAD payload into a 2 MiB staging area, and on a
//! zero-length DNLOAD ("end of transfer") flushes the buffer to
//! the OTA inactive slot (KERN_A.BIN / KERN_B.BIN) via
//! [`robot_os_fs::vfs_*`].
//!
//! ## What is stubbed
//!
//! The actual USB device-controller register programming
//! (DWC2 on JH7110, similar on K1) is NOT wired here — the
//! hardware was not yet on hand when this module was written
//! (pre-Julio 2026). The entry points [`feed_setup_packet`] and
//! [`feed_dnload_payload`] are the seams the controller driver
//! calls once available. See the `// TODO(hw):` markers.
//!
//! The signature-verify hand-off in `finalize_manifest()` is a
//! stub that always succeeds — real secure-boot integration goes
//! through [`robot_os_ota::secure_boot`] after the .SIG file is
//! also DFU-uploaded (out of scope for DEV02; tracked separately).
//!
//! OPEN ISSUE, for whoever wires the controller: because of that
//! stub, this path writes an unauthenticated image straight over
//! `KERN_{A,B}.BIN` — the same class of problem as the OTA
//! receiver's, which is now gated by
//! `secure_boot_verify_staged_detailed()` in `cmd_ota_recv`. DFU
//! cannot copy that fix as-is: it has no way to receive the `.SIG`
//! sidecar (DFU carries one opaque byte stream, and the functional
//! descriptor here advertises a single alt-setting), and it is the
//! recovery path of last resort, so a hard signature requirement
//! with no way to supply a signature would make a bricked board
//! permanently unrecoverable. Deciding how a signature reaches this
//! path — a second alt-setting, or a container framing the image
//! and its signature together — is the same OWNER DECISION as the
//! OTA `.SIG` transport. What IS enforced here today is a minimum
//! image size (`DFU_MIN_IMAGE_SIZE`), which stops a zero-length
//! DNLOAD from truncating a live slot to nothing.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! DFU runs on a dedicated USB device-mode task. All state lives
//! in a single static behind a `SpinLock`, accessed only from
//! that task plus the IRQ handler that delivers Setup packets.
