//! Innosilicon HDMI TX — minimal fixed-mode driver. VF2-only, feature-gated
//! behind `hdmi` (see crate root doc comment).
//!
//! Register offsets confirmed as hardware facts against Linux mainline's
//! `drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/inno-hdmi.c` (used as primary-source reference,
//! not copied — see the licensing note in the crate root and `dc8200.rs`).
//! This chip uses byte-addressed (8-bit) registers, unlike DC8200's
//! word-aligned layout.
//!
//! **The PHY calibration values in this file are UNCONFIRMED** — see
//! `phy_init()`'s doc comment. Everything else here can be correct and
//! this will still show no signal on a real monitor until that's fixed.
