#![no_std]
//! DC8200 + Innosilicon HDMI TX framebuffer driver — VF2 only.
//!
//! Feature-gated behind `hdmi` (opt-in, not part of the `vf2` feature
//! bundle — see `kernel/Cargo.toml`), which also enables this crate's own
//! `vf2` feature (see `Cargo.toml`) gating everything below — without it,
//! this crate compiles to an empty no-op, since plain `cargo build
//! --features <anything>` builds every workspace member regardless of
//! that feature, and this crate's real body needs VF2-only MMIO
//! constants that don't exist for other boards.
//!
//! Fixed 640x480@60 VESA mode, no EDID negotiation, single plane,
//! solid-color milestone — deliberate simplifications agreed before
//! writing any of this, given the real scope of a full display stack
//! (see `docs/KERNEL_REVIEW_NOTES.md`, "Framebuffer/HDMI (VF2)").
//!
//! # Status: never validated against real hardware
//!
//! QEMU has no model for either DC8200 or the HDMI TX — there is no
//! boot-test path for this driver the way every other fix this session
//! had. `hdmi::phy_init()` in particular writes placeholder PHY
//! calibration values that are NOT confirmed correct (see that
//! function's doc comment) — expect no signal on a real monitor until
//! that specific gap is closed with real hardware/TRM data.
//!
//! # Licensing note
//!
//! Register offsets/addresses here are hardware facts, confirmed against
//! Linux mainline driver source used as primary-source reference (same
//! footing as a datasheet) — not copied from that GPL-licensed code. This
//! module's structure, abstractions, and Rust code are written from
//! scratch for this (Apache 2.0) project.
