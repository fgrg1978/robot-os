//! Verisilicon DC8200 display controller — minimal single-plane, fixed-mode
//! driver. VF2-only, feature-gated behind `hdmi` (see crate root).
//!
//! Register offsets and addresses below are hardware facts (MMIO
//! addresses, register layout, bit positions) confirmed against Linux
//! mainline device tree source and the Verisilicon DRM driver's own
//! register headers as primary-source reference — not copied from that
//! driver's code, which is GPL-licensed and structured very differently
//! (regmap abstraction, DRM CRTC/plane framework). This module is a
//! ground-up Rust implementation of just the sequence this crate needs:
//! program one fixed timing, point one plane at a framebuffer, enable.
//!
//! Never validated against real hardware — QEMU has no model for this
//! peripheral at all, so there is no QEMU boot-test path the way every
//! other driver fixed this session had. First real exercise happens in
//! the VF2 hardware bring-up plan's display phase.
