//! Wind / disturbance estimation for multirotors (D04).
//!
//! Estimates the steady horizontal acceleration acting on the craft that is
//! **not** explained by the commanded tilt — i.e. aerodynamic wind drag plus
//! any other slow disturbance — and converts it into a feed-forward tilt bias
//! that would counteract it.
//!
//! ## Why acceleration-residual (not velocity- or position-error)
//! A working position controller drives ground velocity *and* position error to
//! zero in steady state even under constant wind, so neither encodes wind once
//! converged. What always encodes wind is the **acceleration residual**:
//! ```text
//!   a_residual = a_measured − a_commanded
//! ```
//! In steady flight the craft's true horizontal acceleration equals the sum of
//! the commanded thrust-tilt acceleration and the wind drag acceleration, so the
//! residual converges to the wind contribution (this is the PX4/ArduPilot
//! approach). The estimator is a first-order low-pass (IIR) over that residual.
//!
//! ## Frames & units (consistent with `ekf.rs`)
//! - NED: N=north, E=east, D=down. Horizontal pair is `(north, east)`.
//! - Body: X=forward (nose), Y=right, Z=down.
//! - Accelerations in **mm/s²**. Angles in **centi-degrees** (cdeg).
//! - Attitude sign convention matches `rc_to_target`: positive `pitch_cdeg`
//!   leans the craft so it accelerates **forward**; positive `roll_cdeg`
//!   accelerates **right**.
//!
//! ## Statelessness / testability
//! [`WindEstimator`] holds only its own filtered estimate. Every input is passed
//! explicitly to [`WindEstimator::update`]; it never reads global state (EKF,
//! attitude channel), so it is unit-testable as a pure struct.
