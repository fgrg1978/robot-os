//! PID velocity controller for wheeled robots — 4WD differential drive.
//!
//! The robot has 4 motors wired as 2 channels (left pair, right pair).
//! Each channel has an encoder. The PID loop reads encoder ticks, computes
//! the velocity error against the desired speed (ticks/s), and adjusts PWM
//! output accordingly.
//!
//! This module lives in the drivers crate; the kernel's RT motor task glues
//! it with encoder reads (from robot crate) and motor writes.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! 1. Call `motor_pid_init()` once at startup.
//! 2. From the deliberative layer, call `motor_pid_set_target(speed_l, speed_r)`
//!    where speeds are in encoder ticks per second.
//! 3. From the RT motor task, call `motor_pid_tick(ticks_l, ticks_r)` every
//!    `PID_DT_MS` ms. It returns `(pwm_l, pwm_r)` to apply to the motors.
//! 4. Use `motor_pid_enable(false)` to bypass PID for direct PWM control.
