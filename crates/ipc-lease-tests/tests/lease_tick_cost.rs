//! Cost of `lease_tick()` in the timer ISR — deterministic, host-only, no QEMU.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! `lease_tick()` runs **inside** the timer ISR (`kernel/src/main.rs`, arm
//! `INT_TIMER_S`, wrapped in `probe!("lease_tick", ...)`). The IPC audit
//! widened its predicate from `state == Active` to
//! `matches!(state, Active | Pending)` — correct (a lessor with a deadline
//! whose lessee never accepted used to sleep past its own deadline), but it
//! makes the ISR do strictly more work per tick, and nobody had measured how
//! much.
//!
//! # What changed since, and what these gates now protect
//!
//! Measuring it produced the finding the audit recorded but did not act on:
//! the worst case was fine, and the **common** case — "no lease carries a
//! deadline", which is the normal state of this robot — paid 157 instructions
//! in the callee plus 85 in the caller's drain loop to do nothing at all,
//! every single timer tick, on every hart.
//!
//! `lease_tick` now takes `(now, &mut [u32; MAX_LEASES]) -> usize` and
//! short-circuits on an atomic count of armed leases. Both halves were
//! necessary and the audit said so: a bare early exit saves **nothing**,
//! because the 256-byte return array is materialised through the caller's
//! `sret` pointer before any test can skip it.
//!
//! Two consequences for this file, both structural rather than cosmetic:
//!
//!  * The old invariant — "the trip count is `MAX_LEASES` whatever the table
//!    holds, and that is what makes it ISR-safe" — is **deliberately false
//!    now** and has been replaced by the property that actually matters:
//!    all-or-nothing, never a partial scan
//!    (`the_trip_count_is_all_or_nothing_never_partial`), plus a correctness
//!    gate that the exit fires **only** when nothing was due
//!    (`the_early_exit_fires_exactly_when_no_lease_is_armed`).
//!  * Every instruction figure is now **callee + caller**. With `lto = false`
//!    the caller's output buffer cannot be optimised away, so charging only
//!    the callee would report a saving obtained by moving work across the
//!    call boundary.
//!
//! The first attempt used the in-tree `[ISR-WCET]` diagnostic under QEMU and
//! failed as an instrument: it only prints above 1 ms, and with the host
//! loaded it produced a spectacular false positive (36 events vs 3) that was
//! pure host load. That episode is written up in `docs/IPC_AUDIT_2026-08-22.md`.
//! Hence: host, deterministic, and biased towards **counted work** over the
//! clock.
//!
//! # Why an integration test and not `#[cfg(test)] mod` in the lib
//!
//! The lease suite lives inside `crates/ipc/src/lease.rs`'s own
//! `mod tests`, serialised against each other by a `SERIAL: Mutex<()>` that is
//! private to that module and unreachable from here. Those tests share the one
//! process-wide `LEASES` static. A sibling module in the same test binary would
//! need to fill all 16 slots and would race them. An integration test is a
//! **separate binary, hence a separate process**, so it gets its own `LEASES`
//! and cannot perturb — or be perturbed by — the lib suite.
//!
//! The price is that `__lease_reset_for_tests` / `__lease_state_for_tests` are
//! `#[cfg(test)]` and do not exist here. Neither is needed: `lease_free(i, 0,
//! true)` (privileged) clears any slot — and it goes through the same
//! `refresh_deadline_count` the kernel does, so the early-exit counter stays
//! consistent with the table the test built — and the *outcome* under test is
//! the lessor list `lease_tick` reports.
//!
//! # What is measured, and how
//!
//! **Counted work (primary).** Three instrumented models — `tick_old_model`
//! (pre-audit, `Active` only), `tick_prev_model` (audit predicate, no early
//! exit) and `tick_new_model` (current) — run over a mirror of the table and
//! count *loop iterations* and *expiry bodies executed*. Three and not two so
//! the predicate widening and the early exit stay **separately
//! attributable**: the middle model is what isolates each change's cost from
//! the other's. Those quantities survive translation to RV64; an
//! abstract "comparison count" would not, and is deliberately not used: `Pending`
//! and `Active` are adjacent discriminants, so `matches!(s, Active | Pending)`
//! lowers to roughly one unsigned range check, i.e. plausibly **zero** extra
//! instructions versus `s == Active`. Counting it as "+1 compare per entry"
//! would report a delta that does not exist in the emitted code.
//!
//! `tick_new_model` is validated against the real `lease_tick` by a differential
//! test over a matrix of table shapes plus a 200-round pseudo-random sweep:
//! same input state ⇒ same lessors reported. That validates **outcomes**, not
//! costs; the cost claims rest on the structural argument, which is why the
//! structure is asserted explicitly below
//! (`the_trip_count_is_all_or_nothing_never_partial`).
//!
//! **Clock (secondary).** Absolute nanoseconds on aarch64-apple-darwin do not
//! transfer to RV64. What is reported is the **ratio between shapes measured in
//! the same run**, with min-of-N absolutes as corroboration only. Min, not mean:
//! the minimum is the least contaminated sample when four other agents are
//! compiling on the same host. **No test in this file gates on a clock value** —
//! a wall-clock ceiling measures host load, not the kernel, which is exactly why
//! `tools/ci_check.sh` carries no time thresholds. The gates below are all on
//! counted work.

// 4. Translating counted work into an RV64 instruction budget
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The counts above are units of work, not time. They become a WCET claim only
// with a per-unit instruction cost, and every constant below was read off a
// **compiled RV64 artifact**, not guessed. Reproduce with:
//
//     CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<scratch> cargo build --release -p robot_os_ipc
//     llvm-ar x <scratch>/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/release/librobot_os_ipc.rlib
//     llvm-objdump -d --section=.text._RNvNtCs..._12robot_os_ipc5lease10lease_tick *.o
//
// The `-p robot_os_ipc` build is used rather than the linked kernel so the
// numbers can be taken while `kernel/src/main.rs` is still on the old drain
// loop. `lto = false` in the workspace profile, so the rlib's code for this
// symbol is byte-identical to what the kernel links.
//
// **The old numbers were re-derived, not inherited.** A byte-for-byte copy of
// the previous `lease_tick` body was compiled in the *same* invocation as the
// new one and disassembled alongside it. It came out at exactly 61 fixed + 6
// per skipped iteration = 157 for the empty table — identical to the figure in
// `docs/IPC_AUDIT_2026-08-22.md`, which is the cross-check that says the
// method is the same method.
//
// The artifact is self-verifying for the predicate question: the loop's state
// test is
//
//     lbu  a4, 0x0(a5)       ; e.state
//     addi a4, a4, -0x1
//     bgeu a4, t2, <next>    ; t2 = 2  →  skip unless (state - 1) < 2
//
// `(state - 1) < 2` selects discriminants 1 and 2 — `Pending` and `Active` —
// so the widened `matches!(s, Active | Pending)` is **one unsigned range
// check**, the same single `bgeu` a bare `s == Active` compiles to. Zero extra
// instructions on the non-expiring path. This is why abstract "comparison
// counts" were rejected in favour of iterations and bodies.
//
// The deadline test is fused the same way (`ld` / `addi -1` / `bgeu` folds
// `expire != 0 && now >= expire` into one branch).
//
// **The caller is counted too.** With `lto = false` the callee is opaque, so
// the output buffer the caller declares is materialised on every tick no
// matter what the callee does. Charging only the callee would report a saving
// produced by moving work across the call boundary — the exact trap the audit
// flagged when it said a bare early exit "saves nothing".
