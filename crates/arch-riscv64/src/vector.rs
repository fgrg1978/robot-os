//! Cross-arch `vector::*` surface for RISC-V.
//!
//! Mirrors [`arch-aarch64::vector`] and [`arch-x86_64::vector`] so
//! kernel call sites can write `robot_os_arch::vector::dot_f32_best`
//! and get the right impl on every ISA without `cfg(target_arch)`
//! soup in the caller (Item 2 Stage 3 batch 4).
//!
//! The RISC-V-specific kernels (`dot_f32_rvv`, `matmul_f32_rvv`,
//! the bench harness) stay in [`crate::rvv`] — this module is just
//! the portable face of the same code, doing the V-extension
//! detection internally instead of pushing it onto callers.
