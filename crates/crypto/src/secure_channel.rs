//! Secure channel — encrypted brain↔robot protocol (F07.4/F07.5).
//!
//! Wraps the binary brain protocol in AES-128-CTR encryption with
//! SHA-256 HMAC for integrity. Key agreement via X25519.
//!
//! ## Handshake (simplified PSK + ECDH)
//!
//! 1. Robot → Brain: `HELLO` + robot_public_key (32 bytes)
//! 2. Brain → Robot: `HELLO` + brain_public_key (32 bytes)
//! 3. Both compute: shared_secret = X25519(my_private, their_public)
//! 4. Derive four keys — one (enc, mac) pair **per direction**:
//!      enc_c2s = SHA-256(shared_secret || "ENC" || "C2S")[0..16]
//!      mac_c2s = SHA-256(shared_secret || "MAC" || "C2S")[0..16]
//!      enc_s2c = SHA-256(shared_secret || "ENC" || "S2C")[0..16]
//!      mac_s2c = SHA-256(shared_secret || "MAC" || "S2C")[0..16]
//! 5. All subsequent packets: AES-CTR(tx enc_key, nonce) + HMAC(tx mac_key)
//!
//! ## Direction labels — read this before touching the KDF
//!
//! `C` and `S` name **crypto handshake roles**, not TCP roles, and in this
//! system the two are swapped. The kernel is the TCP *client* (it dials the
//! brain) but the crypto *responder*; the brain is the TCP server but the
//! crypto initiator (`robot-brain/protocol.py` calls `start_handshake`,
//! `kernel/src/main.rs` calls `brain_responder_handshake`). So:
//!
//! ```text
//!   C2S  =  initiator → responder  =  brain → kernel
//!   S2C  =  responder → initiator  =  kernel → brain
//! ```
//!
//! Getting this backwards produces a channel that fails closed (nothing
//! decrypts), not one that is subtly weak — but it will look like a network
//! bug, so the mapping is spelled out here rather than left to inference.
//!
//! ## Encrypted packet format
//!
//! ```text
//! Offset  Size  Field
//! 0x00    12    Nonce (random 8 bytes + 4-byte counter)
//! 0x0C    2     Encrypted payload length (LE)
//! 0x0E    N     Encrypted payload (AES-128-CTR)
//! 0x0E+N  32    HMAC-SHA-256 over [nonce || length || ciphertext]
//! ```

    /// further in — it re-parses `recv_buf` for multiple *brain-protocol*
    /// packets after the envelope is stripped. Bytes dropped here never
    /// reach it. A `PKT_ESTOP` (0x88, emergency stop) coalesced behind any
    /// other command was therefore silently lost, and the brain sends ESTOP
    /// exactly once with no ack and no retransmit
    /// (`robot-brain/server.py`, `robot-brain/api.py`). This is the K-C3/C4
    /// dropped-coalesced-frame bug reappearing one layer out, on the
    /// emergency-stop path.
    ///
    /// Note that returning `(len, consumed)` only *enables* the fix; the
    /// gap is not closed until the caller actually loops on `consumed`.
    ///
    /// ## There is NO anti-replay here, on purpose (K-C5)
    ///
    /// This function keeps no receive-side counter and no nonce window. A
    /// captured frame replayed inside the *same* live session decrypts and
    /// verifies every time. The replay defence for the brain link lives one
    /// layer in, at `behavior::auth_envelope`'s `HIGHEST_RX_NONCE`
