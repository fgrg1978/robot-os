//! Pure hart-liveness accounting for [`crate::smp::wake_harts`].
//!
//! In its own file only so the host test runner (`crates/sched-wake-tests`)
//! can compile it: `smp.rs` reads `tp` with inline RISC-V assembly and links
//! against `_secondary_start`, so it can never leave the target. Nothing here
//! has a dependency, and `smp.rs` calls it rather than keeping a copy.
//!
//! # What "online" means, and why it is not a headcount
//!
//! `NUM_ONLINE_CPUS` is consumed as a **prefix bound**: `find_best_cpu` in
//! `scheduler.rs` iterates `0..num_online` and indexes `PER_CPU[i]` directly,
//! and `rebalance_from_offline_cpus(online, total)` treats `online..total` as
//! the dead harts whose ready queues must be drained. So the published number
//! must satisfy exactly one property — **every hart in `0..online` is
//! running** — and a plain count of successes does not satisfy it as soon as
//! there is a hole (hart 2 dead, hart 3 alive).
//!
//! The previous accounting seeded `online = 1` for the boot hart and then
//! incremented per success while a `prefix_intact` flag held. That is correct
//! if and only if the boot hart is hart **0**, because the seed is what claims
//! slot 0. Measured in QEMU virt, the boot hart was hart **2**: with any
//! `hart_start` failure the seeded 1 then stands for a hart nobody started.
//! Concretely, boot hart 2 with hart 0 failing published `online = 1`, i.e.
//! "hart 0 is alive" — the one hart that is not — so every unpinned task went
//! to a dead hart and `rebalance_from_offline_cpus(1, 4)` drained the *live*
//! boot hart's own queue onto it.
//!
//! Recording liveness as a bitmask and deriving the prefix afterwards makes
//! the result independent of which hart happens to boot, which is the whole
//! fix. The result stays conservative rather than unsafe: a live hart past a
//! hole sits idle (see [`stranded`]) instead of a dead hart receiving work.
