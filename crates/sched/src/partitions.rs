//! Adaptive Partitioning Scheduler — RFC-0004.
//!
//! Splits the CPU among the five [`SchedClass`] groups, guaranteeing
//! each its `min_pct` budget per partition window while letting
//! under-served classes opportunistically borrow surplus.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! At each scheduling tick:
//!
//! 1. **Time accounting** — the running task's class is debited the
//!    elapsed `dt_us`.
//! 2. **Window roll-over** — if `now_us - window_start ≥ window_us`,
//!    every class's `consumed_us` is reset and `window_start` shifts
//!    to the next boundary.
//! 3. **Class selection** — iterate classes in urgency order
//!    (SafetyCritical → Idle):
//!    - If a class has tasks runnable AND `under_min(window_us)`
//!      → pick that class (must serve guaranteed minimum first).
//!    - Otherwise, among classes whose budget isn't exhausted,
//!      pick the most-urgent runnable one.
//! 4. The selected class's [`Policy::pick_next`] returns the task.
//!
//! ## Properties (verified in `formal/tla/sched_aps.tla`)
//!
//! - **Guaranteed minimum**: as long as a class has runnable tasks,
//!   it receives at least `min_pct` of the window.
//! - **Bounded interference**: a misbehaving lower-class task cannot
//!   starve a higher-class task by more than one window.
//! - **No deadlock**: the combinator always picks a runnable task if
//!   any exists.
