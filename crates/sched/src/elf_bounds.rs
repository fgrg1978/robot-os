//! Pure bounds checks for the `PT_LOAD` headers of a ring-3 ELF image.
//!
//! Split out of `process.rs` for one reason: `process.rs` cannot be built for
//! the host (PTE flags, the physical allocator, inline assembly), so **not one
//! of these bounds was ever unit-tested**. Every rejection below fires only on
//! a malformed or hostile image — exactly the class that a QEMU boot of a
//! well-formed binary never exercises, so "it boots" was never evidence that
//! any of them worked. This module has no dependencies at all, which is what
//! lets `crates/sched-wake-tests` compile it verbatim (`#[path]`) and probe
//! the edges directly.
//!
//! `process.rs` **calls** this; it does not keep a copy. The three limits
//! arrive in [`SegLimits`] from their real single-source definitions
//! (`vmm::USER_GUARD_LIMIT`, `process::USER_LOW_MAX`, `mmu::PAGE_SIZE`) rather
//! than being redeclared here, so this file can never drift away from them.
//!
//! Under this build profile (`panic = "abort"`, `overflow-checks = true`) an
//! arithmetic overflow reboots the board, and `exec` is reachable from ring 3
//! with a fully attacker-chosen 64-bit `p_vaddr`/`p_memsz`/`p_offset`. So
//! every addition here is `checked_`/`saturating_`: a rejected image must
//! return `Reject`, never reset the robot.
