//! Host stand-in for `robot_os_sync`.
//!
//! The real crate calls `robot_os_arch::csr` (`crates/sync/src/spinlock.rs:15`)
//! to save and restore `sstatus.SIE`, which exists only on RISC-V, so
//! `robot_os_sync` cannot be built for the developer host. The kernel modules
//! that `crates/ipc-chan-tests` pulls in with `#[path]` need `SpinLock` and
//! nothing else from it.
//!
//! This crate's *library* is named `robot_os_sync` (see `[lib] name` in
//! `Cargo.toml`) so those sources resolve `use robot_os_sync::SpinLock;`
//! without being edited. Mutual-exclusion semantics match the real lock; the
//! interrupt discipline is absent, and nothing under test depends on it.
//!
//! Used by exactly one crate. Do not depend on it from anything that ships.
