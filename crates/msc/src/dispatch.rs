//! CBW → SCSI → CSW dispatcher.

//! Pure helper that ties the three pre-existing layers together
//! into a single one-shot call:
//!
//!   1. Parse the 31-byte CBW arriving on bulk-OUT.
//!   2. Decode the SCSI CDB.
//!   3. Execute the command against a `BlockDevice` (immediate
//!      INQUIRY / READ_CAPACITY responses; multi-block READ_10
//!      and WRITE_10 still need the caller to pump bulk endpoints
//!      block-by-block).
//!   4. Encode the 13-byte CSW with the correct residue + status.
//!
//! Lives in the msc crate (rather than in the kernel `msc_gadget`
//! glue module) so that host tests in `crates/msc-tests` can
//! exercise the SCSI→LBA mapping without pulling in the kernel.
