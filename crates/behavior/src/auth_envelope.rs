//! HMAC-SHA-256 authenticated envelope for the brain↔kernel TCP stream.
//!
//! Pairs with `robot-brain/secure_channel.py` byte-for-byte. Wrapping
//! a brain protocol packet adds 26 bytes of overhead (8B nonce + 16B
//! truncated HMAC + 2B inner length).
//!
//! ## Threat model
//!
//! Without this layer the brain↔kernel TCP stream is plaintext on a
//! presumed-trusted LAN. Any peer on the segment can:
//! - Forge an ESTOP packet (`PKT_ESTOP=0x88`) and stop every robot.
//! - Replay an old "FORWARD 100" actuator command indefinitely.
//! - Inject malformed packets to crash the kernel parser.
//!
//! With this layer the attacker would need the pre-shared key to
//! produce a valid HMAC. The replay-protection (monotonically
//! increasing nonce) ensures even captured-and-replayed authentic
//! packets are rejected.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! ```text
//! Offset  Size  Field
//! 0x00    8     Nonce (monotonic u64, big-endian)
//! 0x08    16    HMAC-SHA-256 over (dir || nonce || len || inner) trunc 16
//! 0x18    2     Inner length (LE u16)
//! 0x1A    N     Inner brain protocol packet
//! ```
//!
//! `dir` is a 3-byte ASCII direction label that is **prepended to the MAC
//! input but never transmitted** — the receiver knows which direction it is
//! reading from and supplies the label itself. The envelope layout is
//! therefore byte-identical to before; only the MAC value changes.
//!
//! ## Direction labels
//!
//! ```text
//!   C2S  =  brain  → kernel   (the direction the kernel UNWRAPs)
//!   S2C  =  kernel → brain    (the direction the kernel WRAPs)
//! ```
//!
//! `C`/`S` follow the RFC-0019 *crypto* roles used by
//! `robot_os_crypto::secure_channel` — brain = initiator = "client",
//! kernel = responder = "server" — which are the inverse of the TCP roles
//! (the kernel is the TCP client; it dials the brain). Both layers use the
//! same convention so there is one thing to remember, not two.
//!
//! Without this label both peers computed the MAC over identical input with
//! the same key, so a frame the kernel *sent* was a valid frame *inbound*
//! at the kernel. The MAC proved "someone holding the PSK produced these
//! bytes", not "the brain produced these bytes"; anyone able to echo a TCP
//! segment could reflect the kernel's own traffic back at it and have it
//! authenticate. It was not exploitable only because kernel→brain packet
//! types (`0x01`/`0x02`/`0x03`) and brain→kernel types
//! (`0x80`/`0x83`/`0x88`) are disjoint, so the dispatcher ignored the
//! reflected frame *after* believing it. That is a naming convention
//! holding a cryptographic flaw closed.
//!
//! ## Key management
//!
//! The 32-byte symmetric key is loaded from `/fat/LINK.KEY`
//! (raw bytes). When the file is missing, the channel falls back to
//! plaintext mode and logs a warning — explicit opt-in.
//!
//! **Unless `link-encrypt-enforced` is compiled in** (K-C5), in which case
//! there is no fallback and no HMAC-only mode either: see
//! [`link_policy_denial`] and the `LINK_ENCRYPT_ENFORCED` const below.

// ── K-C5: encrypted mode is mandatory when the policy is compiled in ────
//
// ## Why the gate is HERE, per packet, and not only at establishment
//
// `wrap` and `unwrap_consuming` are the choke point for the brain-protocol
// dispatch path in both directions: `send_framed` calls `wrap` on every TX
// frame, and the RX drain loop in `kernel/src/main.rs` calls
// `unwrap_consuming` on every inbound one, encrypted or not.
//
// A gate at handshake time only proves that *a* handshake was attempted at
// connect; it says nothing about the frame in front of you. The kernel's
// brain loop keeps the session as an `Option<EncryptLink>` and both
// `send_framed` and the RX loop `match` on it — every `None` arm is a path
// that skips the AEAD layer entirely. Those arms are reachable today whenever
// `CFG_LINK_ENCRYPT` is 0 (which is the DEFAULT), and they would stay
// reachable after any future edit that forgets the establishment check.
// Putting the gate on the frame makes "is this byte allowed on this link?" a
// question asked about the byte, not about the connection it arrived on.
//
// ## Paths in kernel/src/main.rs that do NOT pass through here
//
// Audited 2026-08-22, re-audited and CLOSED at their call sites 2026-08-23.
// They are outside this crate, so their gates live in the kernel; each calls
// `link_policy_denial()` (no-op when the policy is off) — if a new brain-link
// sender or receiver appears, it must be added here and gated the same way:
//
//   * the TCP camera pump (`PKT_CAMERA` → `tcp::send_all_with_yield`): gated
//     on `link_policy_denial().is_none()` AND `!is_authenticated()` — raw
//     camera frames are plaintext-mode only, since in keyed HMAC-only mode
//     they would desync the brain's envelope reader.
//   * the UART bridge (PKT_SENSOR/PKT_CAMERA out, PKT_ACTUATOR in): a full
//     brain-protocol plane with no envelope in either direction — gated as a
//     whole by `bridge_policy_permits()` in main.rs, with a one-shot refusal
//     announcement mirroring `announce_denial`.
//   * `i2_holdoff_probe` (`#[cfg(feature = "qemu")]`, synthetic bulk to the
//     brain socket): early-returns under the policy.
//
// So the honest claim for this gate is: **no envelope frame is produced or
// accepted while no AEAD session exists.** It is not per-frame provenance —
// the registry is session-scoped, not a witness threaded through each call —
// and it does not cover a caller that never calls `wrap` at all. What it does
// cover is exactly what K-C5 is about: the replayable HMAC-only and plaintext
// modes of the brain-protocol path.
//
// ## What it costs, in operations
//
//   enforced:  1 acquire load + compare + branch (the AEAD-session check)
//              + 1 volatile bool read (`is_authenticated`, already there)
//   off:       0 — `LINK_ENCRYPT_ENFORCED` is a `const`, so the arms below
//              are const-folded out and the binary is byte-identical to
//              before this change.
//
// Against the ~3 SHA-256 compressions (≈192 rounds, ≈1500 RV64 ops for a
// minimum-size frame) that `hmac_sha256_precomputed` spends immediately
// after, and the AES-128-CTR + 32-byte HMAC the AEAD layer spends around it.
// Under 0.2%. There was no throughput argument for the cheaper placement.

    // where both could accept the same replayed frame).
    //
    // K-C5 (RESOLVED — the mark stays, and here is why it is still the
    // only replay defence in the stack).
    //
    // HIGHEST_RX_NONCE lives in RAM only. It survives TCP reconnects while
    // the kernel is up but resets to 0 on reboot, so in HMAC-only mode a
    // recorded frame replays into the window between reboot and the first
    // legitimate brain frame (brain nonces derive from time_ns, so any
    // recorded nonce beats a zeroed mark).
    //
    // The owner chose "require encrypted mode" over "persist the mark":
    // zero flash wear, no rollback policy, and a keyless boot leaves the
    // robot with no link — fail-closed. `link-encrypt-enforced` implements
    // that; the gate is at the top of this function and of `wrap`.
    //
    // That closes the REBOOT gap, because a frame recorded before the reboot
    // is encrypted under the previous session's `rx_mac_key` and fails the
    // AEAD MAC before it ever reaches this layer (pinned by
    // `aead-link-tests::frame_from_a_previous_session_does_not_decrypt_in_a_new_one`).
    // It does NOT make this check redundant: `SecureChannel::decrypt_consuming`
    // tracks no receive counter at all — read it — so within one live session
    // a captured AEAD frame decrypts and verifies every time it is replayed.
    // The `fetch_max` below is the ONLY thing that rejects it. Deleting it
    // because "the AEAD handles replay now" would reopen in-session replay of
    // ESTOP and actuator commands.
    //
    // Adding a receive-counter high-water mark to `SecureChannel` instead was
    // considered and rejected: the brain resets `_tx_counter` to 0 on rekey
    // (`robot-brain/secure_channel.py`, `_rekey_counter`), so a strict
    // monotonic check there would reject every frame after the first rekey.
    // Rekey is dormant today, which makes it a landmine rather than a bug.
